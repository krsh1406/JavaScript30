# 30 - Whack A Mole Game

## Things I learned
- By making this I identifed various loopholes & how to keep in mind them.
- Learn about `Math.random()` function
- Understand difference between **setTimeout** & **setInterval**
- The understanding behind making function is very deep. It took time for me to grasp how it works.
- I think of it as a player part & machine part. For player it has function `startGame()` & `bonk` functions. For machine part it has `randomTime(min, max)`, `randomHole(holes)` & `peep()` functions.

## Some important things
- I have not focussed more on CSS. So, I copied most from starter files of it.
- Btn CSS is added at last. To most btn to center I have usef flexbox for this.
